# firstRepository

Hello my name is Dominique. This is my first github repository.
I need to learn how to use git and github quickly for my class.
First I'm learning how to do a pull request and how to make a
commit.

Doing pull request now. Just created a new branch. This shit is
hard as fuck!

Sincerely yours,
Dominique Moore
